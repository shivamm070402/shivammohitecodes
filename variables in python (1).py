#In Python, variable names, function names, and keywords are all case-sensitive.
#This means that if you define a variable "x" and then try to refer to it later as "X", Python will treat it as a different variable, and you'll get an error. 
#Similarly, if you try to call a function "print" instead of "Print", Python will also give you an error.

x = 5  
X = 10  
print(x)  # Output: 5  
print(X)  # Output: 10
